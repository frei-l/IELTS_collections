# Bondi Beach

In the early 1800s, swimming at Sydney’s beaches was a controversial pastime. Convicts were forbidden from bathing in Sydney Harbour because of “the dangers of sharks and stingrays, and for reasons of decorum.” By the 1830s, sea bathing was a popular activity despite being officially banned between 9:00am and 8:00pm.

During the 1900s, these restrictive attitudes began to relax and the beach became associated with health, leisure, and democracy—a playground everyone could enjoy equally.

## A Popular Spot

There is clear evidence—in the form of significant Aboriginal rock carvings in particular—that Aboriginal people occupied sites in the area now known as Waverley in the period before European settlement. An important type of tool was first found in the region and is still known as the Bondi point. A number of place names within Waverley, most famously Bondi, have been based on words derived from Aboriginal languages of the Sydney region.

The beginnings of the suburb go back to 1809, when the early road builder, William Roberts, received from Governor Bligh a grant of 81 hectares of what is now most of the business and residential area of Bondi Beach.

In 1851, Edward Smith Hall and Francis O’Brien purchased 200 acres of the Bondi area that embraced almost the whole frontage of Bondi Beach, and it was named the “The Bondi Estate.” Between 1855 and 1877 O’Brien purchased Hall’s share of the land, renamed the land the “O’Brien Estate,” and made the beach and the surrounding land available to the public as a picnic ground and amusement resort.

As the beach became increasingly popular, O’Brien threatened to stop public beach access. However, the Municipal Council believed that the Government needed to intervene to make the beach a public reserve. It was not until June 9, 1882, that the Government acted and Bondi Beach finally became a public beach.

Waverley Council built the first surf bathing sheds in about 1903 and by 1929 an average of 60,000 people were visiting the beach on a summer weekend day. The opening of the pavilion that year attracted an estimated crowd of up to 200,000.

By the 1930s, Bondi was drawing not only local visitors but also people from elsewhere in Australia and overseas. Advertising at the time referred to Bondi Beach as the “Playground of the Pacific.”

Bondi Beach hosted the beach volleyball competition at the 2000 Summer Olympics. A temporary 10,000-seat stadium, a much smaller stadium, 2 warm-up courts, and 3 training courts were set up to host the tournament.

Bondi Beach is the end point of the City to Surf Fun Run, the largest running event in the world, which is held each year in August. The race attracts over 63,000 entrants who complete the 14 km run from the central business district of Sydney to Bondi Beach. Other annual activities at Bondi Beach include Flickerfest, Australia’s premier international short film festival in January, World Environment Day in June, and Sculpture By The Sea in November. In addition to many activities, the Bondi Beach Markets are open every Sunday.

## The Surf Lifesaving Movement

The increasing popularity of sea bathing during the late 1800s and early 1900s raised concerns about public safety and how to prevent people from drowning. In response, the world’s first formally documented surf lifesaving club, the Bondi Surf Bathers’ Life Saving Club, was formed in 1907. Surf patrol members wearing their distinctive red and yellow quartered caps first appeared at Bondi that summer. Many key features of surf rescue were established in those early years, including several Australian inventions.

From Bondi, the surf lifesaving movement spread initially through New South Wales and then to the rest of Australia and the world. With the reassuring presence of surf lifesavers on duty, beaches became places of exhilarating swimming and surfing rather than potential tragedy.

Along with the digger and the bushman, the surf lifesaver held an iconic place in Australia’s cultural imagery. The lifesaver grew to become an accepted feature of the beach and a symbol of what was seen to be good about being Australian.

This was powerfully reinforced by the dramatic events of “Black Sunday” at Bondi in 1938. Some 35,000 people were on the beach and large waves were sweeping through the bathing area. The lifesavers rescued 300 people. The largest mass rescue ever attempted at the time, it demonstrated the place of the lifesaver in the national imagination.

## Sharks and Shark Nets

Since 1937, not one person has died from a shark attack at Bondi. However there have been several shark sightings at Bondi. Swimmers are alerted to the presence of sharks by the first line of defence for many decades has been shark nets.

Shark nets are used on open ocean beaches in QLD and NSW. They are simply a straight, rectangular piece of mesh attached to the water between buoys. They are anchored at either end, usually about 200 metres along the beach and at a depth of 6 metres. The mesh holes are 50cm wide; small enough to entangle sharks, but big enough to leave smaller fish alone. The nets act as a deterrent by disrupting the territorial swimming patterns of sharks. In a typical 20km stretch of coastal surf beach, a strip of net will be set up every couple of kilometres along the beach.
