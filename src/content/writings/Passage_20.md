# The Dutch Tulip Mania

A
Tulips have long held a significant role in Dutch history and culture ever since they were introduced to the Netherlands from the Ottoman Empire in the mid-1500s. So strong was the Dutch love affair with tulips during the Dutch Golden Age that tulips became one of the most coveted luxury items never seen before by Europeans. Tulips were first introduced to Europe from seeds sent to Vienna. Shortly after 1554, these seeds were sent to the Netherlands, where their popularity began to rise. A university study in 1593 led to the discovery that tulips could withstand the harsh northern European climate, further boosting their desirability in the Netherlands.

The Golden Century is the name of the period in Dutch history between 1500 and 1700 when the poor city of Amsterdam was one of the richest of all cities in Western Europe due to its strong international trade ties. Trading companies played an important role in the Netherlands trade with Indonesia and other faraway lands. This booming economy led to a flourishing of the arts and culture, as well as a trade in blue glass, China, and other luxury goods.

Dutch trade with foreign lands led to the importation of exotic goods that were never seen before by Europeans. Tulips were first introduced to Europe from seeds sent to Vienna, and seeds to Venice. Shortly after 1554, these seeds were sent to the Netherlands, where their popularity began to rise. A university study (1593) led to the discovery that tulips could withstand the harsh northern European climate, which further boosted their desirability in the Netherlands.

Tulip plants originate in the form of tulip bulbs which do not flower until seven to twelve years later. Between April and May, tulips bloom for about one week, with bulbs appearing between June and September, thus confining Dutch sales to that season. A rudimentary derivatives market, similar to modern-day options and futures contracts, eventually arose so that traders could conduct trade in tulips all year round. Traders entered into tulip contracts by signing contracts for future tulip purchases before a notary. The very active tulip contract market eventually became an integral part of the overall booming Dutch tulip industry.

As the Dutch tulip market became increasingly sophisticated, tulips were classified into groups and priced according to their rarity. In general, solid-colored tulips were worth less than those with multiple colors. "Couleren" was the classification for solid-colored red, white, or yellow tulips, while "rosen" referred to multi-colored tulips, often red, pink, or white, and "violetten" described the white tulips with purple or lilac on them. "Bizarre" was the most popular tulip, with a yellow background and red, brown, or purple coloration. Tulips that were infected with the benign mosaic virus, which caused "flames" of color to appear upon the petals, sold at a premium due to their unique beauty and rarity.

Tulip prices steadily rose with their growing popularity and bulbs were purchased at higher and higher prices by speculators who planned to turn around and sell them for a profit, similar to modern-day house "flippers." From 1634 to 1637, an index of Dutch tulip prices soared from approximately one guilder per bulb to a lofty sixty guilders per bulb. Traders who sold their bulbs for a profit began to reinvest all of their profit into new tulip bulb contracts or new bulbs to sell to other Dutch citizens or to take with them on trips around the world to sell alongside spices from the Dutch East India Company. Many merchants sold all of their belongings to purchase a few tulip bulbs for the purpose of cultivating and selling them for more profit than they could have ever made in a lifetime as a merchant.

Successful Dutch tulip bulb traders, the archaic counterparts to the day traders of the late 1990s Dot-com bubble and the house flippers of the mid-2000s U.S. housing bubble, could earn up to 60,000 florins in a month—approximately $61,710 in current U.S. dollars. Tulip bulb speculation became so widespread by 1636 that they were traded on Amsterdam's Stock Exchange and in Rotterdam, Haarlem, Leyden, Alkmaar, Hoorn, and other towns. Tulips were traded on the same time, but speculation even spread to Paris, where traders strove to push tulip prices up to lofty levels seen in Amsterdam.

Astronomically high tulip bulb prices resulted in some equally astonishing anecdotes such as the sailor who mistakenly ate an extremely rare specimen thinking it was an onion. This "onion" was so valuable that it could have fed his whole ship’s crew for an entire year. The helpless sailor was jailed for several months for his innocent but costly mistake. Another similar anecdote is of a traveling English botanist who was unaware of the Dutch tulip mania.

Like all bubbles, the Dutch tulip bulb bubble continued to inflate beyond people's wildest expectations until it abruptly popped. The winter of 1636-37: A tulip contract bought by a buyer in Haarlem led to the tulip bulb market to violently implode as the tulip market "bubble" collapsed. Tulip prices fell precipitously as speculators tried to support prices, but to no avail. Within just a few days, tulip prices vanished to a fraction of their former prices. Tulip dealers refused to honor contracts, resulting in a full-blown tulip crash.
