# Thomas Young

Thomas Young was a famous English polymath whose scientific investigations helped unravel the mysteries of sight, light, mechanics, energy, physiology, and Egyptology.

In his recent biography, Andrew Robinson describes Thomas Young as the last man who knew everything—and the first who was seriously in doubt about learning all that there was to know about learning. Thomas Young was arguably the greatest-ever English polymath, a person with encyclopedic, broad and varied knowledge. He proved Newton wrong and showed how we see, cured the sick and deciphered the Rosetta stone, among their feats of genius.

A Career in Medicine

In 1793, Young began to study medicine at St. Bartholomew’s Hospital in London, although he was to leave in 1794 to continue his medical studies in Edinburgh. It was during this time that Young began to distance himself from his Quaker roots. After completing his studies in Edinburgh in 1795, Young travelled to Göttingen in Germany where he was awarded a Doctor of Physics degree in 1796. After obtaining his doctorate, Young moved to Emmanuel College, Cambridge where he taught and also began to research scientific matters outside the scope of medicine.

Having received a substantial inheritance on the death of his uncle, Young moved to London in 1799 and established himself as a physician at 48 Welbeck Street. Although his medical practice was never particularly successful, Young maintained that medicine was his primary occupation and so often published his academic articles anonymously to avoid damaging his reputation as a physician.

An Extraordinary Breadth of Knowledge

Despite the important impact on medical scholarship of his work on haemodynamics and his Young’s Rule for determining drug dosages for children, Thomas Young is perhaps best known for his groundbreaking work in numerous other fields:

Eyesight and Colour

Young’s first submissions to the Royal Society consisted of studies on eyesight, both near and far, and was due to muscles surrounding the lens of the eye that change its shape and therefore its focal length. He also developed a theory, later taken up by the physicist Hermann Von Helmholtz, that ascribed colour vision to three types of receptors in the eye, each with a sensitivity to only one of the three primary colours. It was not until the twentieth century that this theory was confirmed.

Wave Theory of Light

In Young’s own estimation, his discovery that light travelled in waves (thereby disproving Newton’s light particle theory) was his greatest achievement.

Young’s first paper on light, read to the Royal Society in 1800, focused primarily on the difficulties in explaining various phenomena from the viewpoint of the particle theory.

Young’s idea was simple. If light propagates like a wave, such as a wave in water, or a sound wave, then when two of the waves meet so as to reinforce each other, the light will be brighter. But if, as in other waves, they meet when the low point of one and the high point of the other coincide, the waves will interfere with each other and blot each other out.

Young did various experiments to show that this was indeed the case with light, the most famous of which was the famous experiment with two beams of light to pass through two combined light sources demonstrates shadow patterns.

Young’s Modulus

Young was interested in other fields of physics, including the motion of bodies and the properties of materials. He developed a measure, now called “Young’s modulus,” which helps engineers and scientists measure the elasticity of materials.

Egyptology

Towards the end of his life, Young turned his attention back to languages, and became one of the first people to try and decipher hieroglyphics. Although the final translation is often credited to Jean François Champollion, Young made significant advances towards the translation of the Rosetta Stone.

Languages

Young was interested in the evolution of language groups, and divided the world’s languages into five major families: The Manosyllabic, the Indo-subject were published in the African, and the American. His thoughts on this subject were published in a major work titled Quarterly Review in 1813. Based on a work by German philologist Johann, Young compared more than 400 different languages.
