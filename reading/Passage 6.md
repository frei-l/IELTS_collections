# Clarence Saunders

Clarence Saunders was an American grocer who first developed the modern retail **sales model** of self-service. His ideas have had a massive influence on the development of the modern supermarket. Clarence Saunders worked for most of his life trying to develop a truly automated store, developing Piggly Wiggly, Keedoozle, and Foodelectric store concepts.

Born in Virginia, Saunders left school at 14 to **clerk** in a general store. Later he worked in an Alabama coke plant and in a Tennessee sawmill before he returned to the grocery business. By 1900, when he was nineteen years old, he was earning **$30** a month as a salesman for a **wholesale** grocer. In 1902 he moved to Memphis where he formed a grocery wholesale cooperative. Through his experiences he became convinced that many small grocers failed because of heavy credit losses and high **overhead**. Consequently, in 1915 he organised the Saunders-Blackburn Co., a grocery wholesaler which sold for cash only and encouraged its retail customers to do the same.

After leaving Clarksville, Tennessee, on September 6, 1916, Saunders launched the self-service revolution in the USA by opening the first self-service **Piggly Wiggly store**, at 79 Jefferson Street in Memphis, Tennessee, with its characteristic **turnstile** at the entrance. Customers paid cash and selected their own goods from the shelves.

The store incorporated shopping baskets, self-service branded products, and checkouts at the front. Removing unnecessary clerks, creating elaborate aisle displays, and rearranging the store to force customers to view all of the merchandise were characteristics of the early Piggly Wiggly stores.

Though this format of grocery store became the **standard** for its competitors, the style became drastically different from the modern grocery store after opening the first Piggly Wiggly. By 1932, the chain had grown to **2,600** stores doing over **$180 million** annually. Piggly Wiggly stores were both owned by the firm and **franchised**.

The success of Piggly Wiggly encouraged a raft of imitators, including Handy Andy stores, Helpy Selfy stores, Mick-o-Mack stores, and many others, which operated under patented systems. Saunders then listed Piggly Wiggly on the **New York Stock Exchange**.

In the early 1920s, Saunders began construction of a pink marble mansion in Memphis. Then, in early 1923, a group of franchise outlets in New York failed. Because of this financial reversal, Saunders was forced to sell his partly completed Memphis mansion to the city. The mansion, nicknamed the **Pink Palace**, eventually became the city’s historical and natural history museum. Today, the Pink Palace includes a walk-through model of the first Piggly Wiggly store, complete with **2¢ packets** of Kellogg's Cornflakes and **8¢ cans** of Campbell's Soup.

Saunders went on to create the “Clarence Saunders Sole Owner My Name Stores” chain in **1928**. The chain, which was owned by Saunders, initially flourished with **annual sales** of **$60 million** in 1929. However, the chain went into **bankruptcy** in 1930 at the start of the **Great Depression**.

In 1929, the Tigers beat the **Green Bay Packers** 20–6. In 1930 the National Football League invited The Tigers to join their organisation, but Saunders refused their offer. It is claimed that Saunders disbanded his football team because he did not like to travel to other cities for **away games**.

Then, in 1937, Saunders designed and constructed a prototype of an automated store, which he called the “**Keedoozle**” (for “Key Does All”). The Keedoozle was a completely automated store, similar to very large vending machines, based on modern supply chain principles.

Merchandise was displayed as single units each within a glass cabinet under which was a keyhole. Customers entering the store were handed a small pistol-like key that they placed in the keyhole below the goods they wished to buy; the quantity was determined by the number of times they pulled the key’s trigger. This action, recorded on punched tape, activated back office machinery to assemble the order, which was then dispatched to the checkout on a conveyor belt. On reaching the checkout, the customer’s tape was run through a reader to produce the bill, their groceries being assembled, boxed, and waiting for collection. This system eliminated the need for shopping carts; it increased savings in **space**, in the labor needed to stock the shelves, and in the time customers spent queuing at the checkout.

Saunders developed two versions of the Keedoozle. The first was developed in 1937, the development of which was abandoned when the United States entered **World War II**. Saunders returned to the idea in **1948**, opening an improved version. Saunders sold twelve franchises to the revised concept. In **1949** he predicted: “In five years there will be a thousand Keedoozles throughout the U.S., selling **$5 billion** worth of goods.”

Unfortunately, the machinery, much of which Saunders built himself, proved unreliable, particularly at busy times, and the resulting delays coupled with a heavy maintenance bill killed the Keedoozle in **1949**.

Until the time of his death in **October 1953**, Saunders was developing plans for another automatic store system called the “**Foodelectric**.” The Foodelectric concept is a clear **predecessor** to self-checkout. Saunders described it as follows:

“The store operates so automatically that the customer can collect her groceries herself, wrap them and act as her own cashier. It eliminates the checkout crush, cuts overhead expenses, and enables a small staff to handle a tremendous volume... I can handle a **$2 million** volume with only **eight employees**.”

The central invention was a primitive computer, or “**shopping brain**,” which was loaned the shopper, who then roams among the store’s glass-enclosed items. To get a box of noodles, she slips the computer into a slot. The price registers in the computer and the noodle box slides down a **chute**. When she reaches the cashier, there is no need to wait while the prices of individual items are rung up. She simply pays the total displayed on the computer’s windowed forehead.

Saunders had a reputation for **brilliance**, **contrariness**, and eccentricity. Sadly, his death came just as the full impact of his “better idea” for grocery merchandising was becoming apparent; his creative genius was decades ahead of his time.
